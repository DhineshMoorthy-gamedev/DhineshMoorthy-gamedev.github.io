  <div class="Interests">
      <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
      <p>I’m deeply fascinated by the world of interactive technology and its potential to transform how we experience reality. I find immense joy in game design, where I can bring ideas to life and create compelling stories through gameplay. Virtual and augmented reality captivate me not just as emerging technologies but as tools that can reshape industries and redefine user experiences. I’m particularly interested in integrating haptic feedback to add a layer of realism to VR projects. While backend development appeals to my analytical side, allowing me to solve complex problems, I also enjoy the artistic aspects of animation and visual effects, using them to craft immersive digital worlds. Beyond my work in Unity, I’m intrigued by drone technology and its innovative applications. I’m always on the lookout for new trends and advancements in AI, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge fields that push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
